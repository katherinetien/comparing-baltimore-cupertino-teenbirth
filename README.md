# Comparing Teenage Birth Rate in Baltimore, MD and San Francisco, CA with Opportunity Atlas Data
## Background Information 

Last summer, I worked with the Baltimore City Health Department (BCHD) for a federally-funded project to address health-related social needs of pregnant women. One day, as I sat across from the fourth pregnant teenager I had interviewed that week alone, I knew I had stumbled upon a public health crisis. According to data from the [Strategic Plan to Reduce Teen Births in Baltimore City](https://www.healthyteennetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/StrategicPlanReduceTeenBirthsBaltimoreCity.pdf), average teen birth rates in Baltimore city are three times the national average and are disproportionately high in Black and Hispanic populations.

Recognizing the disparities in access to healthcare due to income level, I wanted to delve further into the trends of racial disparities in populations of the same income level. We will use open data from Opportunity Atlas to analyze the differences in teen birth rates as determined by race, looking only at low-income populations in Baltimore, MD and my hometown, San Francisco, CA. 

## Business Question

_How do health-related racial disparities contribute to teen birth rates of populations with low parent income in Baltimore, MD and San Francisco, CA?_ 

## Data Question - Open Data 

We will use open data from Opportunity Insights' [Opportunity Atlas](https://opportunityinsights.org/data/?geographic_level=0&topic=0&paper_id=1652#resource-listing), an online database of anonymous data following 20 million Americans from childhood to mid-30s with the goal of identifying areas of the United States with best and worst social mobility. We will compare Baltimore, MD and San Francisco, CA, using two datasets. 
1. Baltimore, MD: this dataset contains the teenage birth rates for low-income White and Black populations categorized by neighborhood in Baltimore City. 
1. San Francisco, CA: this dataset also contains the teenage birth rates for low-income White and Black populations categorized by neighborhood in San Francisco.
